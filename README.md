# Hello and welcome to year one IBCS!

For the final exam, you will be responsible for everything in this repository save for the following directories:
- apis or ml5
- extras
- gui

You will choose to focus on machine learning or api calls

## Why use this?
This course draws off many resources to give explantions to the programs covered during the course. Each resource will be mentioned and linked in each folders readme. 

These resources are meant to be read! The notes here largely come from these resources and from my own notes and writings. This document is meant to help your studying and understanding- not as a replacement for your own reading, research, and notes: aka learning! Your grade comes from applying what is covered here. Knowing what a word means and using the idea are two different things.

### Many one small steps

The readme's are your user documentation for each unit. meaning, it will cover what you need to know and do.

wide range of skill sets, which is a plus.

# Summer Work

Summer work is broken into 2 parts: programming and questions.

- Sources may be shared on slack
- Your code must be commented on by one of your peers (try using atom & teletype)
- Your final repo should be linked in slack
- [how to add a collaborator on github](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7920320/adding-a-collaborator-to-my-free-github-account)
- [markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

#### Things to Consider

- If you are going to a summer camp where you program, please use that code!
- Your IA section C can count for this work
- Your teacher can be contacted via email for help at anytime

## Part 1: Programs to Create

All programs should be pushed to github with comments explaining how the code works. See any program in this repo for an example.

You may combine all program exercises into one program, two programs, or one program for each item. As long as the following key items are met, you will get full credit:

- recursive algorithm [recursive link](https://gitlab.com/year_one_ibcs/year_of_dog/tree/master/unit_2)
- algorithm using the access methods of a queue, stack, or array [adt & algorithm link](https://gitlab.com/year_one_ibcs/year_of_dog/tree/master/adt)
- algorithm using the access methods of a hash [hash link](https://gitlab.com/year_one_ibcs/year_of_dog/tree/master/unit_0/programming/advanced_programs)
- Create a program using OOP [oop link](https://gitlab.com/year_one_ibcs/year_of_dog/tree/master/oop)
- Create a program that makes use of an API call [api link](https://gitlab.com/year_one_ibcs/year_of_dog/tree/master/apis)
- IA section C
- Build a python or rails server that sends out json data

## Part 2: Questions and Vocab

In your class repo create a new dir called networks. Answer the following questions in networks by creating a readme.md

- protocol

- data packet

- Identify different types of networks.

- Explain why the speed of data transmission across a network can vary

- Explain why compression of data is often necessary when transmitting across a network.

- Explain how data is transmitted by packet switching

- Outline the advantages and disadvantages of wireless networks

- Describe the hardware and software components of a wireless network

- Describe the characteristics of wireless networks

- Describe the different methods of network security

- Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each method of network security

- Identify the technologies required to provide a VPN

- Evaluate the use of a VPN
